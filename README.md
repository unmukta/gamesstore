This is my first project, which is a simple e-commerce (games store) website with a working database. The project includes PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an SQL database. This project can be used as a college project. Feel free to use this :)

**Note:** The SQL database must be added manually with fields for [username, email, password]. Database name: loginandregister

You need Xampp  to host php website on local host.

**Suggestion:** Consider redesigning the login and registration pages as they appear outdated. Also, replace 'Add Your@' with your social handle, and 'Invincible Gaming' with your company name.
